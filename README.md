# Flourish-Blotts---Bookstore-Management-System

Problem Statement & Proposed Solution:
----------------------------------------
In the pandemic, bookstores are having a harder time remaining profitable. To retain
customers most businesses had to hastily start selling online orders, but this is not integrated
properly with existing systems. A bookstore needs to collect customer data and integrate that
with data from book inventory, employee management, etc. into one place rather than separate
books or Excel files to understand customer needs and improve business.
A bookstore management system is proposed to help the business grow by integrating and
compiling data from their business areas like book inventory, orders, employees, etc. in one
single place to understand customer needs and to keep up with the competition.



Files and their purposes:
-------------------------
1. create.sql: Create statement to drop and create database tables
2. load.sql: Insert statement to load data
3. generate_data.py: Python script which was used to generate data
4. conf.json: Config for the python script
